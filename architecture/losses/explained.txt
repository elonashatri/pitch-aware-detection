Loss Function Design Summary
These loss functions work together to train our hierarchical music notation detection system:

Detection Losses:

FocalLoss: Addresses class imbalance in musical elements
BoxRegressionLoss: Regresses bounding boxes with smooth L1 loss
ClassBalancedLoss: Handles extreme class imbalance using effective number of samples



Staffline-Specific Losses:

StafflineDetectionLoss: Specialized for detecting thin, horizontal stafflines using heatmaps and offsets
StaffCompletenessLoss: Enforces the music theory constraint that staves have exactly 5 stafflines with consistent spacing


Relationship Losses:

RelationshipLoss: Trains the graph neural network to model connections between musical elements
RelationshipConsistencyLoss: Enforces domain-specific constraints (like noteheads connect to stems)


Hierarchical Detection Loss:

Combines all loss components with appropriate weighting
Balances detection accuracy, staffline constraints, and relationship modeling
